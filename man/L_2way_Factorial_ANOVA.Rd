\description{
This function calculates supports for independent samples ANOVA. One support is
for the full model versus null (no factors), and the second is for full model
versus main effects. Two contrasts can be specified which can be used
to explore interactions. Each should be given
as a vector arranged as means for factor1 changing first (see example). If only the first
contrast is specified then this is compared to the main effects model. If a second
contrast is specified then the first contrast is compared to it.
Corrected support is given where appropriate, using
Akaike's correction (Hurvich & Tsai (1989)). No correction is necessary for the
two contrasts support since they both involve 1 parameter. Unequal group sizes are
accommodated, using type III sums of squares. F, p and partial eta-squared values
are given for the two factors and their interaction.
