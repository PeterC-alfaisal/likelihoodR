Description: A collection of functions that calculate the log likelihood (support)
    for a range of statistical tests. Where possible the likelihood function and likelihood interval for the 
    observed data are displayed. The evidential approach used here is based on work by Edward
    (Likelihood, 1992), Royall (Statistical Evidence, 1997) and others.
