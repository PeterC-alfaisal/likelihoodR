Description: A collection of functions that calculate the log likelihood 
    (support) for a range of statistical tests. Where possible the likelihood 
    function and likelihood interval for the observed data are displayed. The 
    evidential approach used here is based on the book "Likelihood" by A.W.F. 
    Edwards (1992, ISBN-13 : 978-0801844430), "Statistical Evidence" by R. 
    Royall (1997, ISBN-13 : 978-0412044113), S.N. Goodman & R. Royall

    Psychology as a Science" by Z. Dienes (2008, ISBN-13 : 978-0230542310),
